								<p>     Iraq is a country in the middle east, southwestern Asia. Around 2014 Isis began taking and capturing parts of Iraq forcing many to flee and become refugees. It was around this time that Hamzah Abudljawad was forced to migrate along with his family and would eventually make his way to the United States. His family chose America because his dad worked here before and it would make it easier to get a green card. They specifically chose Houston, Texas because of the diversity already here so it would be easier for him to fit in. Hamzah expected peace and safety, and hoped he would fit in with the culture here, which he would. He left Iraq with his mom, dad, and all his brothers. Sadly he was forced to leave behind the rest of his family and any friends he used to have. Luckily his cousin and his family were already living here so he was able to stay with them for some time while his family was getting used to the new life. </p>
								<p>     He found getting used to the new culture a bit difficult and learning the language was a big challenge. Though he has adapted to the United States he still misses being around people with the same culture and language as him. Once he was able to learn the language though his greatest joy became his friends he made. He felt very welcomed and never felt unwelcomed since coming here. His first day in school showed this very well as “everyone was very friendly and accepting about me and my culture”. In the future he wishes to move back to Iraq so he can live with his family and culture. Finally, Hamzah had one piece of advice to give those who may be in the same situation as him or even just being forced to move somewhere new. He said, “that is will be fine and that they will fit in and make friends”. Though the reason he was forced to move was saddening he has found happiness in his new home.</p>
