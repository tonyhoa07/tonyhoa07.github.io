								<p>Zainab Shabbir Moiz Ali is an immigrant from Dubai. She migrated from Dubai to Houston. Dubai is a city in the United Arab Emirates. Dubai has a lot of luxury shopping places and beautiful skyscrapers. Dubai is also known for its nightlife. Zainab mentioned in the interview that she used to get ice cream with her friends at 1 am. There are also many marine animal parks. Zainab said that she loved her life there. She had many great friends and a whole life in Dubai. When her father wanted them to move, she felt upset because she would miss her friends. Her father wanted her family to move to Houston because of pull factors. Her father wanted better jobs and better opportunities. She went through voluntary migration to get to Houston.</p>
								<p>It took her a while to get used to life here in Houston. Stores are not open as late, and it is a whole new environment. She described the move as scary and nerve-racking. She was scared she wouldn’t make any friends here. Once she got the Houston, she said that she felt like she did not belong. She felt alone and isolated. She later found life here easier once she made so new friends. She also calls her friends in Dubai whenever she misses them. Finally, Zainab had important advice to give to anyone who is moving to a different country. She said, “I want them to know that they are not alone and that there are other people who also go through what you're going through.” Though the journey has not always been easy, Zainab enjoys life in Houston.</p>
